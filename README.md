# Greenhouse Gases and Climate Change Prediction

Through supervised machine learning, this project makes perceivable the direct impact that the increasing atmospheric concentration levels of greenhouse gases have on the progressive heating of our planet. Without due change, as time passes, the greenhouse gas concentration levels are predicted to increase, which will lead to increasing temperatures on our planet, as corroborated by the machine learning model created herein. This phenomenon is pervasively known as Global Warming.
